# Data Analysis with Python course projects


This repository contains 5 projects I did at the end of Data Analysis with Python course. This course is being provided by freeCodeCamp.

The course helped me to become familiar with important libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and SciPy. I learned how to read data from various sources, and manipulate and visualize them by using mentioned libraries. 

You can access [my medium article](https://medium.com/@beratdincerr/data-analysis-with-python-certificate-by-freecodecamp-58ae12ee68cb) in which I provided a summary of how I completed these projects.

After completing the projects, I also obtained a [certificate](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc32e45fc1-2229-4579-94ac-34a80a072386/data-analysis-with-python-v7) by freeCodeCamp.
